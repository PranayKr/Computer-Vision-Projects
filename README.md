# An Implementation of Graph SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2-D world environment of a Robot Agent

The project aims at a Python Code Implementation to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time .

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) gives a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. 

The Graph SLAM logic is implemented by initialization and updation of Constraint Matrix Omega and Constarint Vector Xi .
These Constraint Parameters Omega and Xi maintain data regarding relationship between Robot Positions between consecutive time steps 
and relative Landmark Locations with repect to Robot Position over eaxh time step

The SLAM implementation relies on the robot moving in a 2-D World and then sensing i.e. taking measurements of its surroundings using various Robot Sensors to estimate its current position in world and also the relative positions of the Landmarks present in the world thereby simultaneously able to localize itself while dynamically creating a map of its immediate surroundings as it moves

A World grid with landmarks in it is generated throuh code and then data is generated by placing a robot in that world which moves and senses over some numer of time steps

An example of a 2D robot world with landmarks (purple x's) and the robot (a red 'o') located and found using only sensor and motion data collected by that robot over multiple time steps

# FINAL RESULTS SHOWCASE:
(NOTE: the changing position of the Bot (Red Circle) as it moves and gathers sensor data over multiple time steps)
