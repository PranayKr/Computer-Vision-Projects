# A Facial key point Detection System using Convolutional Neural Net to detect faces, predict location of facial key points (eyes, nose, mouth) by looking at any image. 
Basically this has been implemented in 2 ways :
1)	Building ConvNET from scratch and then training the model to detect facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) on a set of images
2)	Used the model built in the first case to detect facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) on another set of images using Transfer Learning
