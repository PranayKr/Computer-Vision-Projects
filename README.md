# An Implementation of Graph SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2-D world environment of a Robot Agent

The project aimed at a Python Code Implementation to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time .

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) gives a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. 

# RESULTS SHOWCASE :

# An example of a 2D robot world with landmarks (purple x's) and the robot (a red 'o') located and found using only sensor and motion data collected by that robot
